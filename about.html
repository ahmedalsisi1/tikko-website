  <h1>About Tikko</h1>

  <p>
    Tikko is not just another cryptocurrency. It’s a movement, a vision, and a new kind of digital revolution driven by the community, for the community. Tikko was born from the idea that true value doesn't come from promises, but from belief, unity, and a shared dream.
  </p>
  <p>
    This is not a project based on unrealistic roadmaps or hollow marketing. Tikko is built on the strength of its people. Our golden token dropped from the skies—figuratively speaking—to symbolize wealth, purity, and a future filled with potential.
  </p>
  <p>
    The community around Tikko is what makes it truly special. We’re not here to convince anyone with exaggerated claims. We simply invite you to explore, research, and decide if you believe in the future we’re building. No forced narratives—just a token, a vision, and a growing group of believers.
  </p>
  <p>
    Our mission is to build a decentralized platform where value is created by utility, not hype. Whether Tikko becomes a currency for decentralized exchanges, gaming, NFTs, or Web3 ecosystems, its growth will come organically with adoption—not manipulation.
  </p>
  <p>
    We encourage long-term holders, but we do not guarantee profits. Tikko is built to last, and we welcome everyone who truly believes in the power of community-backed cryptocurrency.
  </p>
  <p>
    Are we the next big thing? Maybe. But even if we aren’t, we will still be one of the most authentic communities in the crypto world.
  </p>
  <p>
    Tikko is here. It’s golden. It’s glowing. And it’s only just getting started.
  </p>
