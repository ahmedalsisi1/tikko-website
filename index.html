      <h2>ðŸš€ The Legendary Origin Story</h2>
      <p>
        In a world where trust faded, and all hope seemed lost, a spark was born in the dark â€”
        the Tikko symbol. Created not as a project, but as a call to unite a community that believes
        in fairness, transparency, and the power of imagination. Tikko was never meant to follow the herd â€” it was destined to lead the unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
        No promises. No roadmap. Just belief. Let Tikko become what the people shape it to be.
